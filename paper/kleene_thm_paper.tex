	\section{Introduction to Formal Language} % (fold)
	\label{sec:introduction_to_formal_language}

		A \textit{formal language} is a set of finite-length sequences called \textit{strings} of \textit{words}.
		The elements of strings are called \textit{symbols}, and are the members of a set known as an \textit{alphabet}, denoted by $\Sigma$.
		Alphabets must be nonempty and finite.
		The string containing no symbols is called the \textit{empty string} and denoted by $\lambda$.\footnote{
			Many texts use $\epsilon$ to denote the empty string.
		}\footcite{lemmings}{1-3}

		The set $\{ \lambda \}$, containing only the empty string, is a valid language over any alphabet, as is the empty set.
		$\emptyset$ and $\{ \lambda \}$ represent different languages --- the former is the language which contains no strings, while the latter is the language containing only the string of no symbols.\footcite{hopcroft}{2}

		Let $a = a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ and $b = b_1 b_2 \dots b_m$ be words over some $\Sigma$. 
		We use the notation $|a|$ to denote the \textit{length} of $a$, which is defined as the number of symbols in $a$, counting any symbol as many times as it appears.
		The \textit{concatenation} $ab$ of $a$ and $b$ is defined by $ab = a_1 \dots a_n b_1 \dots b_m$.
		The string $ba = b_1 \dots b_m a_1 \dots a_n$ is also a concatenation of $a$ and $b$, distinct from $ab$,
		Clearly, $|ab| = |ba| = |a| + |b|$, and $ab$ and $ba$ are both words over the same $\Sigma$ as $a$ and $b$.
		The empty string is an identity under concatenation: $\lambda a = a \lambda = a$.
		Concatenation is an associative operation: $(ab)c = a(bc)$.\footcite{lemmings}{1-3}

		We use the notation $a^2$ to denote $aa$: the concatenation of $a$ with itself. 
		If follows that $a^n$ is the concatenation of $n$ copies of $a$, and that $a^0 = \lambda$.\footcite{salomaa}{1}

		Let $\Sigma$ be any alphabet
		We denote by $\Sigma^+$ the set of all finite nonempty strings of symbols from $\Sigma$. 
		We use $\Sigma^* = \{ \lambda \} \cup \Sigma^+$ to denote the set of all finite strings, empty or nonempty, over $\Sigma$.
		Both 
		It is worth noting that $\Sigma^+$ is a semigroup under concatenation, and that $\Sigma^*$ is a monoid under concatenation, as some texts label these sets by their algebraic properties.\footcite{salomaa}{1}

		Although we alphabets and words to be finite in size, languages are frequently infinite.
		Consider the alphabet $\Sigma = \{ a \}$, which contains only a single symbol.
		The language $\Sigma^+ = \{ a^n \mid n = 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$.
		It should be clear that for any alphabet, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Sigma^*$ will always be infinite.

	\section{Finite Automata} % (fold)
	\label{sec:finite_automata}
		A finite automaton is constructed as a 5-tuple
		\[
			M = (Q, q_0, \Sigma, \delta, F)
		\]
		$Q$ is the set of states in the machine.
		$q_0$ is the initial state of the machine, this is the state of the machine before any input symbol is read.
		$\Sigma$ is the alphabet of possible input symbols to the machine.
		$\delta: Q \times \Sigma \mapsto Q$ is the transition function.
		Given a current state and an input symbol from $\Sigma$, $\delta$ outputs the next state of the machine.
		$F$ is the set of accepting states.
		If, when the last input symbol has been read, the machine's state is an accepting state, the machine is said to accept that input.
	% section finite_automata (end)

	\section{Finite Automata Construction Example} % (fold)
	\label{sec:finite_automata_construction_example}
		We will construct a simple finite automaton to determine if a binary string represents a number divisible by three.
		Denote this $M_3 = (Q, q_0, \Sigma, \delta, F)$.
		Since the inputs are to be binary strings, we know $\Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \}$.
		We can also assume that each state of $M_3$ should represent the value of the current input modulo 3, so $Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2\}$.
		Now we need an initial state. 
		We'll assume that the machine starts at $q_0$. 
		This makes sense, because we could achieve the same result by claiming to prefix every input string with a 0, as this would not change its value.
		Obviously, all numbers divisible by 3 will have a value of 0 modulo 3, so $F = \{q_0\}$.

		Now the only part of $M_3$ left undefined is $\delta$, the set of state transitions.

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					We begin with only the initial state.
					The input so far is $\lambda$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_1}
			\end{exstep}

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					With the 0 as the current state, suppose the first input symbol is 0. 
					Then the number so far is $0_b = 0 = 0 \mod 3$, so we add the following to $\delta$: $(q_0, 0, q_0)$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_2}
			\end{exstep}

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					Now suppose that the first input symbol is 1. 
					Then $1_b = 1 \mod 3$, so we need to add state $q_1$ to our drawing, and add $(q_0, 1, q_1)$ to $\delta$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_3}
			\end{exstep}

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					Now we have all the transitions we need from $q_0$, so we move on to $q_1$.
					We'll assume that the input so far is $1_b$.
					Then if the next input symbol is $0$, we have $10_b = 2 = 2 \mod 3$.
					So we add state $q_2$ to the diagram, and add $(q_1, 0, q_2)$ to $\delta$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_4}
			\end{exstep}

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					But if the next input is $1$, then we have $11_b = 3 = 0 \mod 3$.
					So we add $(q_1, 1, q_0)$ to $\delta$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_5}
			\end{exstep}
			

			\begin{exstep}
				{
				Now we have all possible transitions from $q_1$, so we move on to $q_2$.
				Assume that the input so far is $10_b$.
				if the next symbol is $0$, we will have $100_b = 1 \mod 3$, so we add $(q_2, 0, q_1)$ to $\delta$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_6}
			\end{exstep}
			
			\begin{exstep}
				{
					But if the next input is $1$, we will have $101_b = 5 = 2 \mod 3$.
					So we add $(q_2, 1, q_2)$ to $\delta$.
				}

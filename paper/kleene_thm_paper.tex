	\section{Introduction to Formal Language} % (fold)
	\label{sec:introduction_to_formal_language}
		The foundation of a formal language is an alphabet: a nonempty and finite set of symbols typically denoted $\Sigma$.
		A series of zero or more symbols from an alphabet $\Sigma$ is called a word or string over that alphabet.
		We denote the string of length $0$ by $\lambda$.
		If $\Sigma = \{ a, b \}$, then $a$, $b$, $aaab$ and $\lambda$ are all words over $\Sigma$.
		If $x = abb$ and $y = baa$ are words over $\Sigma$, then so is $xy = abbbaa$.
		This operation is referred to as concatenation: $xy$ is called the concatenation of $x$ and $y$. \cite[pg.~1]{salomaa}


		The length of a word $w$ is denoted $|w|$.\cite[pg.~1]{salomaa}


		We use $\Sigma^+$, called the positive closure of $\Sigma$ to denote the set of all nonempty words over a language $\Sigma$.
		The Kleene closure of $\Sigma$, denoted $\Sigma^*$, is the set of all strings, including the empty string, over $\Sigma$.
		Note that $\Sigma^* = \lambda \; \cup \; \Sigma^+$.

	\section{Finite Automata} % (fold)
	\label{sec:finite_automata}
		A finite automaton is constructed as a 5-tuple
		\[
			M = (Q, q_0, \Sigma, \delta, F)
		\]
		$Q$ is the set of states in the machine.
		$q_0$ is the initial state of the machine, this is the state of the machine before any input symbol is read.
		$\Sigma$ is the alphabet of possible input symbols to the machine.
		$\delta: Q \times \Sigma \mapsto Q$ is the transition function.
		Given a current state and an input symbol from $\Sigma$, $\delta$ outputs the next state of the machine.
		$F$ is the set of accepting states.
		If, when the last input symbol has been read, the machine's state is an accepting state, the machine is said to accept that input.
	% section finite_automata (end)

	\section{Finite Automata Construction Example} % (fold)
	\label{sec:finite_automata_construction_example}
		We will construct a simple finite automaton to determine if a binary string represents a number divisible by three.
		Denote this $M_3 = (Q, q_0, \Sigma, \delta, F)$.
		Since the inputs are to be binary strings, we know $\Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \}$.
		We can also assume that each state of $M_3$ should represent the value of the current input modulo 3, so $Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2\}$.
		Now we need an initial state. 
		We'll assume that the machine starts at $q_0$. 
		This makes sense, because we could achieve the same result by claiming to prefix every input string with a 0, as this would not change its value.
		Obviously, all numbers divisible by 3 will have a value of 0 modulo 3, so $F = \{q_0\}$.

		Now the only part of $M_3$ left undefined is $\delta$, the set of state transitions.

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					We begin with only the initial state.
					The input so far is $\lambda$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_1}
			\end{exstep}

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					With the 0 as the current state, suppose the first input symbol is 0. 
					Then the number so far is $0_b = 0 = 0 \mod 3$, so we add the following to $\delta$: $(q_0, 0, q_0)$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_2}
			\end{exstep}

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					Now suppose that the first input symbol is 1. 
					Then $1_b = 1 \mod 3$, so we need to add state $q_1$ to our drawing, and add $(q_0, 1, q_1)$ to $\delta$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_3}
			\end{exstep}

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					Now we have all the transitions we need from $q_0$, so we move on to $q_1$.
					We'll assume that the input so far is $1_b$.
					Then if the next input symbol is $0$, we have $10_b = 2 = 2 \mod 3$.
					So we add state $q_2$ to the diagram, and add $(q_1, 0, q_2)$ to $\delta$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_4}
			\end{exstep}

			\begin{exstep}
				{
					But if the next input is $1$, then we have $11_b = 3 = 0 \mod 3$.
					So we add $(q_1, 1, q_0)$ to $\delta$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_5}
			\end{exstep}
			

			\begin{exstep}
				{
				Now we have all possible transitions from $q_1$, so we move on to $q_2$.
				Assume that the input so far is $10_b$.
				if the next symbol is $0$, we will have $100_b = 1 \mod 3$, so we add $(q_2, 0, q_1)$ to $\delta$.
				}
				\includestandalone{tikz/mod3_construction/step_6}
			\end{exstep}
			
			\begin{exstep}
				{
					But if the next input is $1$, we will have $101_b = 5 = 2 \mod 3$.
					So we add $(q_2, 1, q_2)$ to $\delta$.
				}

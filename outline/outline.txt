INTRODUCTION
	Basic Concepts of Formal Language Theory
		Def: formal language
		Def: string
		Def: alphabet
		Def: The empty string

		 Ex: {λ} and ∅ as languages

		Def: length of a word, |w|
		Def: concatenation
		 Ex: λ is an identity under concatenation, and concatenation is an associative binary operation

		Def: positive closure of an alphabet
		Def: Kleene closure of an alphabet
		 Ex: positive closure is a semigroup under concatenation, Kleene closure is a monoid under concatenation

		 Ex: positive and Kleene closures are infinite sets
